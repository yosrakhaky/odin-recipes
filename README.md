# odin-recipes
A website of my favourite recipes for my reference and to share with friends and family who enjoy my cooking!
So far in my web development journey, I learned how to create a basic HTML webpage with headings, lists, links and images. This project will incorporate these simple lessons.
As mentioned above, this website will eventually include some of my own personal recipes as well as links to some of my favourites. I often get asked by friends and family how I made a certain dish, so this website serves as a reference for myself and them!
